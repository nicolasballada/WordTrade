    <p>Word Trade aims to create an organized space for buying and selling used textbooks within the UMass Amherst community. Sellers determine prices and handle transactions through PayPal money requests; buyers enjoy filtering and matching with local options. On campus, we expect to operate as a drop-off/pick-up office, reducing the need for shipping, packaging, and messiness. Partnering with other RSO's, Word Trade would be volunteer-run.</p>
    
    <h4>How does Word Trade work online?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Buyers: </strong> filter through Title, Author, ISBN, or Class Code.</li>
        <li><strong>Sellers: </strong> input Name, Phone Number, UMass Email, Student ID, Title, Author, ISBN, Price, PayPal request link for price listed, and Description of use (current condition, damages, and format of book i.e. hardcover, paperback, loose leaf, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h4>How do I drop off/pick up my book?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sellers: </strong> After money transaction has been processed by PayPal, you have 3 days to drop-off your book at our office.</li>
        <li><strong>Buyers: </strong> You will be notified of drop-off and have 5 days to pick-up your new used book from our office.</li>
    </ul>
